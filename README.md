# PixelMaestro
PixelMaestro is a library for creating and rendering 2D animations and patterns. While originally designed for LEDs, it can be used to render RGB values to any device or output.

PixelMaestro is pre-alpha software. New releases can (and likely will) introduce incompatible changes.

## Getting Started
To get started, please read the [documentation](docs/README.md). You can also try the [Qt-based frontend](gui) or [Arduino sketches](arduino).
