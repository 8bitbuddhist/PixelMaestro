# PixelMaestro
PixelMaestro is a library for creating and rendering 2D animations and patterns. PixelMaestro works by manipulating the color values of Pixels, or individual color points, using customizable animations. While originally designed for LEDs, it can be used to generate RGB values for any device or output.

## Getting Started
