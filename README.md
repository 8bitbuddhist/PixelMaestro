## Getting Started

[Click here](https://8bitbuddhist.github.io/PixelMaestro/Tutorial.html) for a tutorial on using PixelMaestro, or read the [documentation](https://8bitbuddhist.github.io/PixelMaestro/).

If you want to run PixelMaestro on an Arduino, you can do so via the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/). For detailed instructions, see the [examples folder](examples/arduino).

## Companion App

PixelMaestro has a companion desktop application called PixelMaestro Studio. PixelMaestro Studio lets you build custom animations, save and share configurations, control devices over USB, and more.
