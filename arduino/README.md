This folder contains sample Arduino sketches. These sketches were created using [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/).

## Configuring PlatformIO
1. Open this folder in PlatformIO.
2. Download any necessary libraries using the PlatformIO package manager.
3. Copy the sketch you want to upload to the `src/` folder.
4. Check that the `lib/PixelMaestro` folder links to the PixelMaestro `src/` folder. If not, create a link or copy the PixelMaestro `src/` folder into this folder.
5. Build and upload the project to your board.

Note that the lib/PixelMaestro folder is a soft link to the PixelMaestro `src/` folder.
